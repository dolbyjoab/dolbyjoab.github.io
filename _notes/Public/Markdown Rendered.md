**Character and Competence**

I am cooperative, practical, and grounded. I feel comfortable with who I am, and I take pride in my good character and my competence. I tend to seek order, security, and stability, and I work hard to maintain my way of things.

**Steady Progress**

They say, I am hardly unimaginative. I simply take inspiration from the past rather than the future. I tend to remain loyal.
My sentinel personality make me thrive in environments that have clear hierarchies and rules. Whether or not I'm in a formal leadership role, I care about setting a good example, and I gain great satisfaction from guiding a well-functioning group. This can make me an excellent manager, and community official, as well as caring parent and host.
